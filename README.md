# IntakeBoundary Canon

This repository defines the canonical behavior, invariants, and scope boundaries of IntakeBoundary.

The canon establishes deterministic normalization, schema enforcement (ICM), and mechanical routing rules that implementations must follow to ensure reproducibility, auditability, and infrastructure-grade reliability.

This repository defines what IntakeBoundary **is** and **is not**. Deviations from these invariants are considered non-conformant.
